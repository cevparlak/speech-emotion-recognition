Table 18: Experiments with 24 MFCC+STER feature set. Number of features is 1760.
IG is the feature set obtained by running Information Gain Attribute selector of Weka on the 24 MFCC+STER feature set. Number of selected features is 1339.
Expert is the feature set that is obtained by manual elimination of some features from the 24 MFCC+STER feature set. Number of selected features is 1220. Acuracy is 90.65% which is the highest score on EmoDB. The result is obtained with 60% training set and 40% test set using Weka’s SVM-SMO. Although we obtained 90.90% accuracy using 61% training set and 39% test set, we did not include this in the paper due to the unusual train-test split.
We also run CFS Subset evaluator on the Emo_Large+STER feature set which has 6984 features. Emo_large is the feature set of openSMILE and has 6669 features. CFS Subset Feature selector reduces the feature space from 6984 down to 128 while increasing the accuracy from 97.45% to 97.96% on EmoSTAR dataset using Weka SVM-SMO classifier with 10-fold cross-validation.
